============

SOA Implementation of jPetstore

Here is the [logical model](https://github.com/leefaus/soa-petstore/blob/master/documentation/logical-model.png) we will be implementing.

The SOA architecture will be built using a combination of:

* MuleSoft ESB
* tcServer (Apache Tomcat)
* GemFire (Session and L2 Cache)
* EnterpriseDB (PostgreSQL)

Our implementation will be based on CXF, Spring JDBC, Spring Data GemFire, and Spring MVC.

More to come as this is an agiile project we will be producing Epics and Stories this week.
